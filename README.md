<h1>Hi, I'm Shinta!</h1>

A fresh graduate from Singapore Management University (SMU), I have gained strong technical skills and experience from my major in Information Systems (Digitalisation and Cloud Solutions). As part of my school projects, I have worked with VueJS framework, Javascript, HTML and CSS for the front-end designing. I am a highly driven individual who enjoys front-end development but is open to learning back-end technologies as well.
